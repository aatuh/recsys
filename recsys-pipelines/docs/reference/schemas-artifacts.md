# Artifact schemas

Artifacts are JSON documents intended for serving systems.

Currently:
- Popularity artifact v1
- Co-occurrence artifact v1
- Manifest v1

Schemas:
- `schemas/artifacts/manifest.v1.json`
- (recommended) `schemas/artifacts/popularity.v1.json`
- (recommended) `schemas/artifacts/cooc.v1.json`

The builtin validator enforces structural rules.
See `explanation/artifacts-and-versioning.md`.
