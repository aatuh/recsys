i uploaded some documentation of an api service. README.md and CONFIGURATION.md files are in the root of project, others are inside /docs/ directory. as technical writer, business presentative, and a senior developer how would you evaluate the documentation in general, and also as a whole: how clear, how understandable, how well they flow from one topic to another, how complete they are. i'm looking for excellent understandability and learnability for someone who doesn't know much about what the system does or its jargon
