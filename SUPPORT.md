# Support

This project supports **self-serve adoption**. We keep support lightweight and mostly asynchronous.

## Community support (free)

- GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- Discussions (if enabled) for questions

We do not guarantee response times for free support.

## Commercial support (paid)

Commercial customers get the support level defined in their order form.

Typical support channels:
- Private support email: `support@YOURDOMAIN` (replace)
- Private issue tracker or GitHub private issues (optional)

**No-meetings policy (default):**
- Support is **async-first**
- Calls are only by exception and must be pre-agreed and time-boxed

## What we can help with
- Installation and upgrade guidance
- Reproducible bug investigation (with logs/configs)
- Security patch guidance

## What we do not provide by default
- 24/7 on-call
- Operating your infrastructure
- Unlimited custom development without a fixed scope

## Before opening an issue
Please include:
- Version/commit hash
- Deployment mode (docker compose / k8s / helm)
- Logs and minimal reproduction steps
