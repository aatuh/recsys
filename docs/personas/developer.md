# Developer

Use this page to orient yourself as the technical owner integrating RecSys into a product or platform.

## What you try to do in the first 10 minutes

- Get a minimal local run working and call `POST /v1/recommend` once.
- Map required data contracts (events + IDs) for one recommendation surface.
- Decide deployment shape (single service vs suite, artifact storage, auth/tenancy).
- Find the contracts you will hand off to application and data teams (API, schemas, required fields).
