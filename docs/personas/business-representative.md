# Business representative

Use this page to evaluate RecSys for fit, risk, and procurement readiness without reading engineering details first.

## What you try to do in the first 10 minutes

- Understand what RecSys does (and what it does not) for your use case.
- Confirm evaluation plan: what you will measure, how long it takes, and what success looks like.
- Find pricing and licensing options and the next procurement step.
- Locate trust artifacts: limitations, security/privacy posture, and evidence examples.
