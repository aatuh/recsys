# Ttechnical writer / documentation lead

This hub is for people responsible for documentation quality, consistency, and release hygiene.

## Your first 10 minutes

1. Read the non-negotiable style rules.
2. Skim the Diátaxis structure and persona hubs.
3. Learn how docs changes are reviewed and enforced.

## What you likely care about

- A stable information architecture (no duplication drift)
- Clear templates and a repeatable doc-writing process
- Quality gates that prevent regressions
- Versioning and redirect hygiene

## Start here

- Quality gates: [Documentation quality gates](../project/docs-quality-gates.md)
- Style guide (canonical): [Docs style guide](../project/docs-style.md)
- Templates: [Docs templates](../project/docs-templates.md)
- Canonical content map: [Canonical content map](../project/canonical-map.md)

## Common tasks

- Add a new page: follow [Docs templates](../project/docs-templates.md) and enforce [Documentation quality gates](../project/docs-quality-gates.md).
- Fix mixed pages: split into one of {tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation} and update nav + redirects.
- Run a docs consistency check: see `scripts/docs_lint.py`.
