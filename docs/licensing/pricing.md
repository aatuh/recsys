# Pricing definitions

This page defines terms used in our commercial pricing and order forms.

For current plan prices and a plain-language overview, see: [Pricing](../pricing/index.md).

## Definitions

- **Tenant**: a logically separate recommendation domain with its own catalog and behavior signals (e.g., brand, product
  line, customer partition).
- **Production deployment**: one production environment serving real end-user traffic (e.g., a Kubernetes
  cluster/namespace or a distinct production installation).
- **Non-production environments**: up to **2 non-prod environments** (dev/staging) per production deployment are included
  at no extra charge.

## Notes

- If your use case involves OEM/resale, multi-region HA across many clusters, or unusually large scale, choose
  **Enterprise** (or contact us for custom terms).
- If there is ever a mismatch between these docs and a signed order form, the **order form** governs.

## Payment & renewal (high level)

- Annual plans are billed annually in advance unless otherwise agreed.
- Renewals are annual. Upgrades are typically prorated.
- Taxes: VAT may apply depending on your location and VAT ID status.
