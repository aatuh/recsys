# Pricing (Commercial License)

This repository includes open-source components (e.g., Apache-2.0 and AGPLv3). A commercial license is available for
organizations that want commercial terms and/or prefer not to adopt AGPL obligations for production use.

All prices below are **EUR, excl. VAT**.

---

## Quick definitions

- **Tenant**: A logically separate recommendation domain with its own catalog and behavior signals (e.g., brand, product
  line, customer partition).
- **Production deployment**: One production environment serving real end-user traffic (e.g., a Kubernetes cluster/namespace
  or a distinct production installation).
- **Non-production environments**: Up to **2 non-prod environments** (dev/staging) per production deployment are included
  at no extra charge.

If your use case involves OEM/resale, multi-region HA across many clusters, or unusually large scale, use **Enterprise**.
