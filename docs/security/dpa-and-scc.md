# DPA and SCC terms (self-serve plans)

This page publishes the default privacy terms used for self-serve commercial procurement.

## Document controls

- Owner: RecSys maintainers (`contact@recsys.app`)
- Last reviewed: 2026-02-08
- Next review due: 2026-05-08

## Scope

Default terms on this page apply to:

- Commercial Evaluation
- Starter
- Growth

Enterprise plans may override these terms in a signed Order Form.

## What is included by default

- Data Processing Addendum (DPA) terms are incorporated by reference via this page.
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) handling is documented for cross-border transfer needs.
- Subprocessor and delivery disclosures are published in:
  [Subprocessors and distribution details](subprocessors.md)

## DPA baseline

The default DPA baseline for self-serve plans is:

- Role model: Customer is controller; Vendor is processor for contracted support and fulfillment activities.
- Purpose limitation: processing only to deliver licensed artifacts, support, and contract operations.
- Security baseline: reasonable technical and organizational measures aligned with the public security posture.
- Deletion/return: contract and legal retention obligations apply; customer runtime data remains customer-controlled.
- Audit model: documentation-first review via published security and procurement artifacts.

Supporting references:

- Security posture and controls: [Security, privacy, compliance](../start-here/security-privacy-compliance.md)
- Procurement artifact index: [Commercial procurement artifacts](commercial-procurement-artifacts.md)

## SCC baseline

If SCCs are required for the transfer scenario, the default approach for self-serve plans is:

- SCC terms are incorporated by reference to this page and the signed Order Form.
- Scope is limited to vendor-processed contract/support metadata unless otherwise agreed.
- Any enterprise-specific SCC rider is negotiated in the Order Form.

## When custom terms are needed

Use Enterprise terms if your legal/security policy requires:

- custom DPA language,
- custom SCC annexes,
- additional transfer-risk controls, or
- controller-to-controller alternatives.

Those customizations are recorded in the signed Order Form.
