# Trust center

RecSys is an auditable recommendation system suite with deterministic ranking and versioned ship/rollback.

## Forward to security (copy/paste)

Start review async by sending this short list:

- Security pack (print to PDF): [Security pack](security-pack.md)
- Security posture snapshot (one-page summary): [Security posture snapshot](posture-snapshot.md)
- Commercial procurement artifacts: [Commercial procurement artifacts](commercial-procurement-artifacts.md)
- DPA/SCC baseline: [DPA and SCC terms](dpa-and-scc.md)
- Subprocessor/distribution disclosure: [Subprocessors and distribution details](subprocessors.md)
- Standard support schedule: [SLA and support schedule](sla-schedule.md)
- Security, privacy, compliance overview: [Security, privacy, compliance](../start-here/security-privacy-compliance.md)
- Production readiness checklist: [Production readiness checklist](../operations/production-readiness-checklist.md)
- Known limitations and non-goals: [Known limitations](../start-here/known-limitations.md)
- Licensing + pricing: [Buyer guide](../pricing/evaluation-and-licensing.md)
- Vulnerability reporting: [Security policy](../project/security.md)

Data ownership stance (short):

- The suite is typically **self-hosted**: you run the infrastructure and own the data.
- Do not send or log raw PII (use pseudonymous stable IDs).

## Who this is for

- Security/compliance reviewers evaluating RecSys
- Engineering leads preparing for a pilot or production rollout
- SRE/on-call engineers who need rollback levers and runbooks

## What you will get

- The shortest path to: data posture → access control → operational readiness
- Links to the exact pages security reviews typically request
- A “security pack” index you can print to PDF
