## How to use this page

Use this list to track what is already public in docs versus what is provided only during commercial contracting.

Status values:

- `Published`: available in the public docs
- `Published (self-serve plans)`: published defaults for Commercial Evaluation, Starter, and Growth
- `Order form`: captured only in signed commercial paperwork (Enterprise/custom overrides)
