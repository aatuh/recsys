## Scope

Default schedule on this page applies to:

- Commercial Evaluation
- Starter
- Growth

Enterprise terms may override this schedule in a signed Order Form.

## Standard plan schedule

| Plan | Default response expectation | Contractual SLA by default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial Evaluation | Best-effort async | No |
| Starter | Best-effort async | No |
| Growth | Async first response target within 2 business days | No |

## Severity reference (when SLA add-on is purchased)

The following severity mapping is used unless overridden in an Order Form:

- `P1`: service unavailable or critical production impact
- `P2`: major functionality degraded with workaround risk
- `P3`: non-critical defect or advisory

Response targets and any service credits are contractual only when explicitly included in a signed Order Form.

## Add-on model

Optional add-ons for Growth/Enterprise:

- 8x5 SLA
- 24x7 SLA

Add-on scope, response targets, and exclusions are recorded in the Order Form.
