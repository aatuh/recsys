# Object Model

The object model docs have been split to make the conceptual and schema-level views easier to consume:

- **Concepts (Week 1):** [`object_model_concepts.md`](object_model_concepts.md) — core objects (Org, Namespace, Item, User, Event, Surface) and JSON examples.
- **Schema mapping (Week 2+):** [`object_model_schema_mapping.md`](object_model_schema_mapping.md) — how those objects map to tables and columns.

Most readers should start with [`object_model_concepts.md`](object_model_concepts.md) and only jump to the schema mapping once they need deeper database insight.
