# Documentation style guide

This repository follows the **Diataxis** structure:

- **Tutorials**: learning by doing
- **How-to**: goal-oriented steps
- **Explanation**: understanding and design rationale
- **Reference**: precise specification (APIs, schemas, config)

## Writing rules

- Prefer short sections and explicit headings.
- Use consistent terminology (see [`glossary.md`](glossary.md)).
- Always include:
  - prerequisites
  - expected outcomes
  - examples and sample outputs (when applicable)
- Prefer relative links inside `/docs`.
- Avoid linking to repository paths that do not exist in the rendered MkDocs site.

## Markdown conventions

- Use fenced code blocks with language hints.
- Use admonitions for warnings and important notes.
- Keep line length readable (wrap long paragraphs).
