Do not paste secrets or customer data into external tools.

We do not guarantee response times for free support.

## Commercial support (paid)

Commercial customers get the support level defined in their signed Order Form.

Default commercial support channels include:

- Private support email which will be provided upon commercial agreement
- Private issue tracker or GitHub private issues

**No-meetings policy (default):**

- Support is **async-first**
- Calls are only by exception and must be pre-agreed and time-boxed

## Support expectations by plan (defaults)

Support terms are finalized in your Order Form. This table shows default terms unless an Order Form overrides them.

| Plan | Response expectations | Channels | Escalation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial Evaluation | Best-effort async (no SLA) | Email / private issues (provided during eval) | By exception |
| Starter | Best-effort async (no SLA) | Support email / private issues | By exception |
| Growth | Async first response target within 2 business days | Support email / private issues | By exception |
| Enterprise | Defined in signed Order Form | Defined in signed Order Form | Defined in signed Order Form |

Notes:

- Premium support/SLA (8×5 or 24×7) is an add-on for Growth/Enterprise (see `pricing/index.md`).
- Standard plan schedule reference: [SLA and support schedule](../security/sla-schedule.md).
