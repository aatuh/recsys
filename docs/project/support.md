# Support

This project supports **self-serve adoption**. We keep support lightweight and mostly asynchronous.

## Community support (free)

- GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- Discussions for questions
- RecSys Copilot (Custom GPT) for docs Q&A: [`chatgpt.com/g/.../recsys-copilot`](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68c82a5c7704819185d0ff929b6fff11-recsys-copilot)

Do not paste secrets or customer data into external tools.

We do not guarantee response times for free support.
