# Self-serve procurement (minimum requests)

Use this page when you want the shortest path from evaluation to commercial activation.

## Goal

Minimize procurement back-and-forth to a single commercial intake request for standard plans.

## Scope

This flow is designed for:

- Commercial Evaluation
- Starter
- Growth

Enterprise is intentionally custom and may require negotiation.

## One-request flow

1. Choose plan and scope from canonical pricing:
   [Pricing](../pricing/index.md)
2. Validate legal/security artifacts from published docs:
   [Commercial procurement artifacts](../security/commercial-procurement-artifacts.md)
3. Fill the order form template using standard defaults:
   [Order form template](../licensing/order_form.md)
4. Send a single procurement request with completed order form and selected plan.

## Required artifact bundle (all published)

- Licensing decision tree: [Licensing](../licensing/index.md)
- Commercial agreement: [Commercial license](../licensing/commercial_license.md)
- DPA/SCC baseline: [DPA and SCC terms](../security/dpa-and-scc.md)
- Subprocessor/distribution disclosure:
  [Subprocessors and distribution details](../security/subprocessors.md)
- Standard support schedule: [SLA and support schedule](../security/sla-schedule.md)
- Security pack: [Security pack](../security/security-pack.md)

## What remains non-self-serve

Enterprise negotiation only, including:

- OEM/resale or third-party hosting rights
- Multi-region HA and regulated-environment commitments
- Custom SLA/service credits
- Custom DPA/SCC/legal riders
- Custom liability cap or other redlines
