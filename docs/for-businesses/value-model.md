# Value model (ROI template)

## Who this is for

- Stakeholders who need a simple “is this worth it?” framing for a RecSys pilot
- Product + analytics teams translating KPI lift into business value

## What you will get

- A lightweight ROI template you can adapt to your domain
- Links to the suite’s measurement and guardrail workflow

## Template (simple, practical)

Recommendations create value only if they move a business KPI while guardrails hold.

A simple framing:

- Incremental value = KPI lift × eligible traffic × value per action
- Cost = engineering + operations + infrastructure

For the full checklist (including risks and mitigations), use:

- ROI and risk model: [ROI and risk model](../start-here/roi-and-risk-model.md)
