# Datasets (tutorial fixtures)
In this tutorial you will follow a guided walkthrough and verify a working result.


## Who this is for

- Developers running tutorials locally
- Anyone who needs a **small, deterministic fixture** for smoke tests and docs examples

## What you will get

- A list of built-in datasets used by tutorials
- Guidance on when to use each dataset

## Available datasets

- **[Tiny dataset](tiny/README.md)**  
  Intentionally small and human-readable. Good for docs, smoke tests, and demos.

## When to use which

- Use **Tiny** when you want:
  - fast local runs
  - deterministic debugging
  - copy/paste-friendly examples
