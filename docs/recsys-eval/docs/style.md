# Documentation style guide

This documentation is written to be:

- human-friendly
- practical and runnable
- honest about uncertainty
- consistent across files

## Voice

- Use "you" and "we".
- Prefer concrete examples over theory.
- Define terms the first time they appear.
- Avoid jargon unless it buys precision.

## Structure

Every doc starts with:

- Who this is for
- What you will get

Every doc contains:

- Examples (commands or JSON)
- Common pitfalls

## Line width and typography

- Keep lines reasonably short (about 80-100 chars).
- Use plain ASCII characters in code and examples.

## Terminology

Use these consistently:

- "exposure": what was shown (ranked list)
- "outcome": what the user did after exposure
- "assignment": experiment bucket (control vs candidate)
- "segment": a slice like tenant+surface+device
- "guardrail": a metric that must not regress
