# Roadmap (high level)

This doc is intentionally short. It exists to set expectations.

## Now (stability and trust)

- streaming-first for big logs
- structured logging and run correlation
- reproducibility: config and dataset fingerprints

## Next (power and sensitivity)

- stronger experiment analysis features (variance reduction)
- better segment regression surfacing
- richer guardrails

## Later (advanced evaluation)

- more OPE diagnostics and ranking-specific estimators
- interleaving variants and deeper analysis

## Non-goals

- training models
- serving recommendations
- replacing a full experimentation platform

## Read next
