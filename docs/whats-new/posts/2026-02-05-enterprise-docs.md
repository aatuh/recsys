# Docs: enterprise feel baseline

This release focuses on **making evaluation easier** for business and technical stakeholders.

## Highlights

- Buyer-centric top-level navigation (Overview / Quickstart / Guides / Reference / Operations / Commercial / Project)
- “Trust signals”: social cards, last-updated timestamps, and page authors (from git history)
- Dedicated hubs for Reference and Operations
- Tags and a real “What’s new” feed (this page)

<!-- more -->

## Notes

- If you prefer a component-centric view, use search and tags to jump straight to `recsys-algo`, `recsys-eval`, or
  `recsys-pipelines`.
