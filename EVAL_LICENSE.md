Evaluation Materials as a service to third parties, or (c) embed the Evaluation Materials in a product or service
offered to third parties.

### 4.3 No public distribution

Licensee must not distribute Evaluation Materials outside Licensee’s organization.

### 4.4 Contractors

Licensee may allow its contractors to access Evaluation Materials only if:

- they are under confidentiality obligations at least as protective as Licensee’s, and
- access is limited to the internal evaluation purpose.

Licensee remains responsible for contractor compliance.

### 4.5 Benchmark publication (optional)

Unless Vendor gives written permission, Licensee must not publish benchmark results of the Evaluation Materials.  
(If you want "maximum openness", delete this section.)

## 5. Term and Expiration

The Evaluation Term begins on the date Licensee first accesses the Evaluation Materials and lasts **30 days**, unless
extended in writing by Vendor.

Upon expiration or termination, Licensee must stop use and destroy all Evaluation Materials in its possession,
including license files/keys and any copied commercial artifacts, except that Licensee may retain evaluation results
and notes that do not contain Vendor Confidential Information.

---

## 6. Confidentiality

Evaluation Materials, license files/keys, and any non-public documentation are Vendor’s confidential information
("Confidential Information").

Licensee agrees to protect Confidential Information using reasonable measures and not disclose it except as allowed
under this agreement. This obligation survives for **3 years** after expiration/termination.

## 7. Feedback

If Licensee provides feedback, suggestions, or evaluation results, Vendor may use them to improve the Software without
obligation to Licensee. Feedback does not include Licensee’s Confidential Information.

---

## 8. Support

Evaluation support, if any, is provided on a best-effort basis and may be limited. Vendor may choose not to provide
support during evaluation.

---

## 9. Open Source Components

If Licensee uses any open-source components of Recsys separately, such components are governed by their respective
open-source licenses. These Evaluation Terms govern only Evaluation Materials provided under this document.
